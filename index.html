          <h2>The Bard of Bengal</h2>
          <h5><i>“At the end of the journey, I am able to see, a little more clearly, the orb of my life. Looking back,
              the only thing of which I feel certain is that I am a poet.”</i></h5>
          <p>A humble statement from India’s greatest man of letters, Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore. This Nobel laureate,
            known as ‘the Bard of Bengal’, was a polymath who had also made significant contributions to literature not
            just as a poet, but also as a dramatist, novelist, short story writer, and writer of nonfictional prose.
            In addition, his creativity also found expression in a plethora of areas such as music, painting, acting and
            teaching. <br> A notable social reformer and freedom fighter, he denounced the British Raj and advocated
            independence from Britain.
            Tagore also played a leading role in Indian cultural renaissance and came to be recognized, along with
            Mohandas Gandhi, as one of the architects of modern India.<br>
            Tagore began writing poetry at a very early age, and during his lifetime he published nearly 60 volumes of
            verse, in which he experimented with many poetic forms and techniques.
            The publication of Gitanjali was the most notable event in Tagore’s career as a writer. Following the
            volume’s publication, he won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1913 which was the first such recognition of
            an Eastern writer.<br>
            Even today, Rabindranath Tagore is often remembered for his poetic songs, which are both spiritual and
            mercurial. He was one of those great minds who was ahead of his time.
